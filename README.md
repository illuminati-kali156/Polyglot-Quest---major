Polyglot Quest - Interactive Language Learning with Deep Learning and Machine Vision"
IDEA / APPROACH DETAILS :
- Our proposed project is an innovative language learning web application that leverages the power of deep learning algorithms and machine vision technology to create an interactive and engaging learning experience. The application is designed to support the learning of multiple languages, including popular languages such as French, German, and many others. 
- The application has two main components that work together seamlessly to provide a comprehensive language learning experience. In the first component, the system acts as a teacher, prompting the user to identify an object, such as an apple, in the chosen language using an audio prompt. The user must then locate the object within a specific time frame of 10 seconds by presenting it to the camera. The system will provide positive feedback or inform the user of any errors , creating a fun and engaging way for users to learn new vocabulary.  
- The second component of the application is equally exciting, as it enables the user to ask questions to the system. By presenting an object to the machine vision technology, the user can receive audio and text feedback on the object's name in their preferred language. This feature allows users to practice their pronunciation and expand their vocabulary while receiving immediate feedback from the system.  
- To support the implementation of the machine vision technology, we will leverage embedded IOT devices, making the application even more accessible and user-friendly. With its cutting-edge technology, interactive interface, and support for multiple languages, our language learning web application is set to revolutionize the way people learn new languages.
